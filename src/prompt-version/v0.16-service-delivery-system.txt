# Plan for B2B Service Delivery System (v0.16) - ERPNext-First Approach

This document outlines an ERPNext-first implementation plan for a system allowing admins to create projects for clients, send invoices, and deliver the final service via email. This approach ensures all data lives in ERPNext from the start.

### **Core Concept: Self-Healing ERPNext DocTypes**

Instead of a manual migration, the application's server actions will be built to be "self-healing." When an action needs a custom DocType or fields, it will programmatically create them before retrying the original request.

---

### **Implementation Steps & Progress**

**Phase 1: Admin Project Creation & Viewing**
- [✅] **Programmatically Add Custom Fields to "Project" DocType**
  - A helper function `ensureProjectCustomFieldsExist()` adds required fields (`service_item`, `status`, `sales_invoice`, `subscription_plan`, etc.) to the standard ERPNext "Project" DocType.

- [✅] **Admin UI: Project Creation Form (`/admin/projects/new`)**
  - A form for creating a new project.
  - Ability to select existing customers from ERPNext.
  - Ability to create a new customer in ERPNext via a dialog if they don't exist.
  - Ability to select a Subscription Plan to determine the invoice amount.

- [✅] **Admin UI: Project List Page (`/admin/projects`)**
  - A data table that fetches and displays all "Project" documents from ERPNext.

- [✅] **Admin UI: Project Detail Page (`/admin/projects/[id]`)**
  - Displays all data for a single "Project" document in a read-only view.

**Phase 2: Invoicing & Payment**
- [✅] **Setup: Email Notification System via n8n**
  - **Why this is needed:** To programmatically send emails for invoices, payment confirmations, and final delivery, we need an email transaction service.
  - **Implementation:** We've created an email service that sends a POST request to a secure n8n webhook. `N8N_EMAIL_WEBHOOK_URL` and `N8N_EMAIL_WEBHOOK_AUTH` must be set in the `.env` file.

- [✅] **Action: Create & Send Invoice**
  - **Goal**: Implement the logic for the "Create & Send Invoice" button on the Project Detail Page.
  - **Workflow Logic**: This button is only enabled when the project's `sales_invoice` field is empty. This prevents creating multiple invoices for a single project. Once an invoice is created and linked, the project's state changes, disabling this action. This ensures a clean, one-project-one-invoice flow.
  - **Implementation Steps**:
    - Create a new `Sales Invoice` document in ERPNext linked to the project's customer and service item.
    - Set the `Sales Invoice` status to `Unpaid`.
    - Use the project's linked `Subscription Plan` to determine the invoice item `rate`.
    - **Integrate Xendit:** Create a Xendit invoice linked to the ERPNext `Sales Invoice` `name`.
    - **Store Xendit URL:** Save the Xendit payment URL back to the `Sales Invoice` document in ERPNext.
    - Link the new `Sales Invoice` back to the `Project` document (update the `sales_invoice` field).
    - Update the `Project` status to `Awaiting Payment`.
    - Trigger an email to the client containing the Xendit payment link via the n8n webhook.

- [✅] **Webhook for Payment Success**
  - Update the Xendit webhook to handle `Sales Invoice` payments (`external_id` starts with `SINV-`).
  - When a `Sales Invoice` is paid, the webhook should:
    - Update the `Sales Invoice` status in ERPNext to `Paid` by creating and submitting a `Payment Entry`.
    - **Self-Heal**: Automatically create the `Mode of Payment` (e.g., "EWALLET - DANA") if it doesn't exist before creating the payment entry.
    - Find the corresponding "Project" document.
    - Update the "Project" status to `In Progress`.
    - Send a confirmation email to the client: "Thank you for your payment. We have started working on your project."
    - Create a new `User` in ERPNext using the Customer's email if one doesn't already exist.

**Phase 3: Service Delivery**
- [ ] **Admin UI: Project Delivery Action**
  - On the Project Detail page, when a project is `In Progress`, a "Deliver Project" section becomes active.
  - Admin enters the `final_service_url` (the live website).
  - A "Send Delivery Email" button will trigger the final step.
  - This action will:
    - Generate a secure, one-time `credential_setup_url` for dashboard access.
    - Update the "Project" document with the `final_service_url`, `credential_setup_url`, `delivery_date`, and set status to `Completed`.
    - Trigger the final delivery email.

- [ ] **Client Delivery Email**
  - The email will contain:
    - A link to their `final_service_url`.
    - A button/link to the `credential_setup_url` to set their password and access their Flarebee dashboard.

**Phase 4: Client-Side Dashboard**
- [ ] **Client UI: My Services / My Projects Page (`/dashboard/my-projects`)**
  - A new page for logged-in clients.
  - It fetches all "Project" documents linked to the current user.
  - Displays a list of their projects (e.g., "Website for PT Jaya Abadi").
  - For `Completed` projects, it shows a link to the `final_service_url` and a link to manage their service within the dashboard.

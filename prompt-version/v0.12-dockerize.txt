    v0.12.1 docker container setup
    Set up a containerized backend environment using Docker Compose. The frontend (Next.js) will run on the local machine for a better developer experience, while all backend services are managed within Docker.

This includes:
- A Dockerfile for the Express.js + TypeScript backend API.
- A docker-compose.yml file to orchestrate the following services:
  - `api_service`: The main backend API with hot-reloading.
  - `postgres`: PostgreSQL database service.
  - `rabbitmq`: RabbitMQ for message queuing.
  - `cms_service`: Placeholder for a future headless CMS.
  - `file_manager_service`: Placeholder for a future file management service.
- An .idx/dev.nix file to ensure the Docker daemon is running in the workspace.
- Updated the main README.md with clear instructions on how to run the separate backend (Docker) and frontend (npm) development environments.
- Decoupled the frontend from the Docker setup to allow for independent development and deployment (e.g., to Vercel).

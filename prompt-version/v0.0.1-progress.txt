Answer:
Based on the current project structure, significant progress has been made, establishing a feature-rich, full-stack application for selling digital services and templates.

**Key Completed Milestones:**
- **Core Architecture:** A robust Next.js application with a clear separation between public, authenticated, and admin areas.
- **Full E-commerce Flow:** Users can browse services/templates, add them to a cart, and complete purchases via integrated payment gateways (Xendit, iPaymu).
- **Comprehensive Admin Panel:** A powerful dashboard allows for complete management of services, templates, orders, customers, site settings, and static page content.
- **User Authentication:** A complete and secure authentication system with email/password and Google login, including role-based access for admins.
- **Advanced Features:** The project includes sophisticated features like a client-side Dev/Live environment switcher for testing, an initial implementation for Single Sign-On (SSO) with satellite services, and integrated asset management via Vercel Blob.

The project is well-structured, functional, and appears to be approaching a production-ready state with a wide range of administrative controls.

# Developer Guide: RIO Technology Solutions & Platform

Welcome to the developer guide for Ragam Inovasi Optima (RIO). This document provides technical insights relevant to understanding our internal platform (admin panel, website) and the broader technological capabilities we employ when delivering diverse solutions to our business clients.

## Our Technology Philosophy
RIO is committed to using modern, robust, scalable, and well-supported technologies. We prioritize:
*   **Client-Centric Solutions:** Selecting the right tools for the client's specific problem, not a one-size-fits-all approach.
*   **Maintainability & Clean Code:** Writing code that is understandable, testable, and easy to evolve.
*   **Integration & Interoperability:** Building systems that can effectively communicate and work with other services.
*   **Security & Reliability:** Ensuring the solutions we build are secure and perform reliably.

## Core RIO Platform Tech Stack
The RIO platform itself (which includes this admin panel, the public-facing website, and any client portals) is built upon the following core technologies:

*   **Framework:** Next.js (App Router) for its hybrid rendering capabilities, performance optimizations, and rich React ecosystem.
*   **Language:** TypeScript for enhanced code quality, type safety, and developer productivity.
*   **UI Library:** React for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
*   **Styling:** ShadCN UI components, built on Radix UI and Tailwind CSS, for a comprehensive set of accessible, customizable UI elements and utility-first styling.
*   **Backend & Database (Primary):** Firebase
    *   **Authentication:** Manages user identities for both customers and RIO administrators.
    *   **Firestore:** A NoSQL, document-based database used for storing application data such as user profiles, order information, site page content (CMS), and potentially metadata for service offerings.
*   **Payment Gateway Integration:** Xendit (primarily for the Indonesian market), with considerations for Stripe or other gateways for broader reach if needed.
*   **File Storage:** Vercel Blob for storing assets like images for site pages or service showcases. (If templates are still offered as downloadable assets, Blob would be used for these too).
*   **AI Integration (Example/Potential):** Genkit for demonstrating or implementing AI-powered features. This could range from internal tools (AI-assisted content generation) to client-facing AI solutions.

## Technologies Leveraged in Client Solution Delivery
Given RIO's expanded service model, the technologies we work with for client projects are diverse and depend entirely on the client's needs and the nature of the solution being built. This includes, but is not limited to:

*   **Frontend Development:**
    *   Frameworks/Libraries: React, Vue.js, Angular, Svelte, Next.js, Nuxt.js.
    *   Static Site Generators: Gatsby, Eleventy.
    *   Mobile: React Native, Flutter, Swift, Kotlin.
    *   Core Web: HTML5, CSS3 (Sass/LESS), JavaScript (ES6+).
*   **Backend Development:**
    *   Languages/Frameworks: Node.js (Express, NestJS), Python (Django, Flask, FastAPI), PHP (Laravel, Symfony), Go, Java (Spring Boot), Ruby (Rails).
    *   Serverless: AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, Firebase Functions.
*   **Database Systems:**
    *   SQL: PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, Oracle.
    *   NoSQL: MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, Elasticsearch, Firestore, DynamoDB.
*   **Content Management Systems (CMS):**
    *   Headless: Strapi, Sanity.io, Contentful, Directus.
    *   Traditional: WordPress, Drupal.
*   **E-commerce Platforms:**
    *   Hosted: Shopify, BigCommerce.
    *   Self-Hosted/Open Source: WooCommerce, Magento, PrestaShop.
    *   Custom builds using various backend and frontend technologies.
*   **Point of Sale (POS) Systems:** Integration with various cloud-based and on-premise POS providers via their APIs or SDKs.
*   **API Design & Integration:**
    *   Protocols: REST, GraphQL, gRPC.
    *   Tools: Postman, Swagger/OpenAPI.
    *   Integration Platforms as a Service (iPaaS).
*   **Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning:**
    *   Platforms: Google AI Platform, AWS SageMaker, Azure Machine Learning.
    *   Libraries: TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, Keras.
    *   LLM APIs: OpenAI (GPT), Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude.
*   **Cloud Computing & DevOps:**
    *   Providers: AWS, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Microsoft Azure.
    *   Containerization & Orchestration: Docker, Kubernetes.
    *   CI/CD: GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, Vercel, Netlify.
    *   Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Terraform, CloudFormation.
*   **Monitoring & Analytics:**
    *   Prometheus, Grafana, Sentry, New Relic, Datadog, Google Analytics.

## Development Workflow & Best Practices (RIO Platform)

*   **Version Control:** Git (hosted on platforms like GitHub/GitLab).
*   **Branching Strategy:** Gitflow or similar feature-branch workflow.
*   **Code Reviews:** Mandatory for all significant changes.
*   **Testing:** Unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests where appropriate.
*   **Linting & Formatting:** ESLint, Prettier to maintain code consistency.
*   **Dependency Management:** `pnpm` (as currently used), `npm`, or `yarn`.

## Contributing to Client Solutions
*   Client projects will have their own dedicated repositories and potentially different tech stacks or development workflows based on project requirements.
*   Emphasis on clear documentation, modular design, and adherence to client-specific needs.

This guide will be updated as the RIO platform and our service capabilities evolve.
